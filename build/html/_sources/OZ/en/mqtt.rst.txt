**MQTT**
========

There's a possibility to collect telemetry and manage some parameters via MQTT protocol.
MQTT server connection settings are available only via the device web-interface, which is available at its local IP address:

``Host``/``Port`` - IP address and port of the MQTT server

``User``/``Password`` - username and password to connect

``Keep alive`` - the maximum allowed period of time without data exchange

``QoS`` - quality of service level

``Publish prefix`` - publication prefix for sending telemetry

``Subscribe path`` - name of the way to subscribe to commands

``Client ID`` - device name

.. note::
		If no authorization is configured on the MQTT server, the ``User``/``Password`` fields are ignored.

Published every minute in the following topics:

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``floorTemp`` - floor temperature sensor readings (`temetry <telemetry.html>`_ **"t.1"**) in °C as "xx.x" (models with floor temperature sensor).

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``airTemp`` - air temperature sensor readings (`temetry <telemetry.html>`_ **"t.2"**) in °C as "xx.x" (models with air temperature sensor).

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``protTemp`` - readings of the internal overheat sensor (`temetry <telemetry.html>`_ **"t.0"**) in °C as "xx.x".

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``setTemp`` - setpoint temperature (`temetry <telemetry.html>`_ **"t.5"**) in °C as "xx.x".

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``powerOff`` - device is turned off `(temetry <telemetry.html>`_ **"f.16"**) by string "0" - on, "1" - off.

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``load`` - load status `(temetry <telemetry.html>`_ **"f.0"**) by string "0" - off, "1" - on.

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``typeCtrl`` – type of control, `temetry <telemetry.html>` **"m.0"** by string "0 - floor ,  "1" - air, "2" - advanced mode

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``maxFlrTmp`` – maximum floor temperature value

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``minFlrTmp`` – minimum floor temperature value

``Publish prefix``/``Client ID``/``get``/``bright`` – display brightness

The following control topics are available:

``Subscribe path``/``Client ID``/``set``/``setTemp`` - setpoint temperature, similar to ``setTemperature`` `parameter <parameters.html>`_.

``Subscribe path``/``Client ID``/``set``/``bright`` - display brightness, similar to ``brightness`` `parameter <parameters.html>`_.

``Subscribe path``/``Client ID``/``set``/``powerOff`` - device shutdown, similar to ``powerOff`` `parameter <parameters.html>`_.

``Subscribe path``/``Client ID``/``set``/``mode`` - selection of the operation mode, similar to ``mode`` `parameter <parameters.html>`_.

``Subscribe path``/``Client ID``/``set``/``typeCtrl`` – by string "0 - floor ,  "1" - air, "2" - advanced mode, similar to ``controlType`` `parameter <parameters.html>`_ 

.. note::
The floor sensor temperature in the user menu and via API changes in 1 °C increments over the entire operating range. The air sensor temperature in the user menu changes in 1 °C increments in the range from -15 °C to -10 °C, in 0.5 °C increments in the range from -10 °C to 75 °C (for devices with an air sensor). The air sensor temperature when controlled via API changes in 0.1 °C increments over the entire operating range (for devices with an air sensor).
