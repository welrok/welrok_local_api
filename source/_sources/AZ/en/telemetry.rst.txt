Telemetry
~~~~~~~~~

Telemetry is used to obtain the current state of device.
To get telemetry, send command ``{"cmd": 4}``, for example, the answer for az thermostat will be:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "sn":"404CCAAAD4E8A89860609800000149",
      "f.0":"1","f.3":"0","f.4":"0","f.7":"0",
      "f.9":"0","f.10":"0","f.11":"0","f.12":"0",
      "f.13":"0","f.16":"0","f.20":"0","m.0":"0",
      "m.1":"0","m.2":"65","m.3":"2","m.5":"0",
      "o.0":"-57","o.1":"1","par.26":"45","par.27":"5",
      "t.0":"470","t.1":"392","t.5":"400","t.7":"640","time":"812112348"
   }

``sn`` - device serial number

``x.n`` is the parameter key, where ``x`` is a group of parameters, ``n`` is the number in the group

``time`` - device current time

``setPointStep`` - setpoint step

``setPointType`` - reserved

Parameter groups:
   * ``t`` - temperature is 1/16 Â°C
      * ``0`` - internal overheating sensor
      * ``1`` - floor
      * ``5`` - current setting
      * ``7`` - microcontroller temperature      
   * ``m`` - modes
      * ``0`` - control type: floor = 0, air (not used in this model) = 1, extended (not used in this model) = 2
      * ``1`` - control type: schedule = 0, manual = 3, away = 4, temporary = 5
      * ``2`` - the number of the current schedule period (the schedule uses all 7 days of the week, each containing up to 16 periods. Accordingly, if the schedule uses all 16 periods every day, the value can range from 0 (representing the first period on Monday) to 111 (representing the last period on Sunday). The example given shows the maximum possible value. There can be fewer periods; for example, if using 2 periods per day, the value range will be from 0 (the first period on Monday) to 13 (the last period on Sunday)
      * ``3`` - blocking type: no blocking = 0, blocking changes from the cloud = 1, blocking changes from the local network = 2, both = 3
      * ``5`` - heating mode (0 - heating, 1 - cooling)
   * ``o`` - other parameters
      * ``0`` - Wi-Fi signal strength in dBm
      * ``1`` - the reason for the last reboot. Depending on the hardware version of the platform, two types of values may be output. The first is a hexadecimal mask, which is read as follows: power-off = 0x04, software reset = 0x08, watchdog timer = 0x10, low voltage = 0x40. The second is a direct value: software reboot due to low MCU supply voltage = 9; software reboot = 3; power reset = 1.
   * ``par`` - duplication of some device `parameters <parameters.html>`_
      * ``n`` - parameter number
   * ``f`` - bit parameters
      * ``0`` - load status: 0 - off, 1 - on
      * ``3`` - no floor sensor: 0 - ok, 1 - no sensor
      * ``4`` - short circuit floor sensor: 0 - no short circuit, 1 - short circuit
      * ``7`` - preheat algorithm is active: 0 - off, 1 - on 
      * ``9`` - internal overheating: 0 - no overheat, 1 - overheat
      * ``10`` - time synchronization issue: 0 - the thermostat's time matches the cloud time; 1 - the thermostat's time does not match the cloud time.
      * ``11`` - time drift issue: 0 - the thermostat's clock is accurate (not lagging); 1 - the thermostat's clock is inaccurate (lagging)
      * ``12`` - overheat protection (internal device temperature sensor circuit): 0 - no error (operating correctly), 1 - error (overheat protection not functioning)
      * ``13`` - load proportional mode (emergency operation mode without floor temperature sensor): 0 - disabled, 1 - enabled
      * ``14`` - digital floor sensor is used: 0 - not used, 1 - used
      * ``16`` - power off state: 0 - on, 1 - off
      * ``20`` - zero-crossing detection circuit error: 0 - no error, 1 - error
