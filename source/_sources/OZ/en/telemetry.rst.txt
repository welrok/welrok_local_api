Telemetry
~~~~~~~~~

Telemetry is used to obtain the current state of device.
To get telemetry, send command ``{"cmd": 4}``, the answer for thermostat will be:

   }

``sn`` - device serial number

``x.n`` is the parameter key, where ``x`` is a group of parameters, ``n`` is the number in the group

``time`` - device current time

``setPointStep`` - setpoint step

``setPointType`` - reserved

Parameter groups:
   * ``t`` - temperature is 1/16 °C
      * ``0`` - internal overheating sensor
      * ``1`` - floor
      * ``2`` - air (for devices with an air sensor)
      * ``3`` - reserved
      * ``4`` - reserved
      * ``5`` - current setting
      * ``6`` - reserved
      * ``7`` - microcontroller temperature      
   * ``m`` - modes
      * ``0`` - control type: floor = 0, air = 1, air mode with floor limitation = 2
      * ``1`` - Operation mode: schedule = 0, expectation = 1, manual = 3, away = 4, temporary = 5, timer = 6
      * ``2`` - the number of the current schedule period (the schedule uses all 7 days of the week, each containing up to 16 periods. Accordingly, if the schedule uses all 16 periods every day, the value can range from 0 (representing the first period on Monday) to 111 (representing the last period on Sunday). The example given shows the maximum possible value. There can be fewer periods; for example, if using 2 periods per day, the value range will be from 0 (the first period on Monday) to 13 (the last period on Sunday)
      * ``3`` - blocking type: no blocking = 0, blocking changes from the cloud = 1, blocking changes from the local network = 2, both = 3
      * ``4`` - reserved
      * ``5`` - heating mode (0 - heating, 1 - cooling)
      * ``6`` - next mode — the mode the device will switch to upon exiting the current timer, away, or waiting mode: = scheduled = 0, expectation = 1, manual = 3, away = 4, temporary = 5, timer = 6. For all other modes = 255 (undefined)
   * ``o`` - other parameters
      * ``0`` - Wi-Fi signal strength in dBm (-127..128)
      * ``1`` - the reason for the last reboot: 9 - software reboot due to low MK supply voltage; 3 - software reboot; 1 - power reset.
      * ``2`` - timer remaining (to get the time in seconds, the value must be multiplied by 5)
      * ``4`` - humidity in % (air sensor data)
      * ``5`` - reason for reboot WCH: WCH reset cause: Other reasons = 0, Reset = 3, Software failure = 4
   * ``par`` - duplication of some device parameters
      * ``n`` - parameter number
   * ``te`` - extra temperatures
   * ``f`` - bit parameters
      * ``0`` - load status: 0 - disabled, 1 - enabled
      * ``1`` - reserved
      * ``2`` - floor limit action (for devices with air sensor)
      * ``3`` - floor sensor break: 0 - no break, 1 - break
      * ``4`` - floor sensor short circuit: 0 - no short circuit, 1 - short circuit
      * ``5`` - air sensor loss: 0 - no loss, 1 - loss (for devices with air sensor)
      * ``6`` - reserved
      * ``7`` - preheat function action: 0 - disabled, 1 - enabled
      * ``8`` - open window function action: 0 - disabled, 1 - enabled
      * ``9`` - internal overheating: 0 - no overheating, 1 - overheating
      * ``10`` - time synchronization issue: 0 - thermostat time matches cloud time, 1 - thermostat time doesn't match cloud time
      * ``11`` - time flow issue: 0 - thermostat time counts correctly (not lagging), 1 - thermostat time counts incorrectly (lagging)
      * ``12`` - overheating protection (internal device temperature monitoring circuit): 0 - no error (working correctly), 1 - error (overheating protection not working)
      * ``13`` - proportional load operation mode (emergency operation without floor temperature sensor): 0 - disabled, 1 - enabled
      * ``14`` - digital floor sensor used: 0 - not used, 1 - used
      * ``15`` - reserved
      * ``16`` - device power off: 0 - enabled, 1 - disabled
      * ``17`` - long load operation time: 0 - no notification, 1 - notification present
      * ``18`` - reserved
      * ``19`` - reserved
      * ``20`` - zero-crossing detection circuit error: 0 - no error, 1 - error
      * ``21`` - cloud time ignoring: 0 - not ignoring, 1 - ignoring
